# Hello! üëãüèª

Hi, I'm Crew, currently a senior studying computer science at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I have several years of experience in both front-end and back-end development, and I am currently pursuing more experience in software engineering!

## Projects:
### [Daily Doodle](https://github.com/crewgamble/Daily-Doodle)
Daily Doodle is a for fun web app that allows users to draw a daily prompt on a virtual canvas and quickly export their masterpiece. 

### [Mushroom Classifcation Neural Net](https://github.com/crewgamble/Mushroom-Neural-net)
This project contains the implementation of a simple neural network model designed to classify mushrooms into either edible or poisonous categories based on 22 different features. Works with 100% accuracy!

### [Cute Crypto](https://github.com/crewgamble/Cute-Crypto)
Cute Crypto is a responsive react website that demonstrates a potential crypto/NFT project homepage.

### [Wine Quality Neural Net](https://github.com/crewgamble/Wine-Quality-Neural-Net)
This repository uses a neural network to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical features.
